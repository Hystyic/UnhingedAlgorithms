# Unhinged Algorithms
Unhinged Algorithms is a repository of algorithms that are horrendous in nature. Our degree is being put at good use here as you can see.

| Name          | Description                                     | Works?                          | Result                                            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| GaslightSort | GaslightSort is a really, really fast sorting algorithm. | Yes, haters will say it doesn't. | You sound pretty dumb saying that it doesn't work. |
| CosmicSort   | Cosmic sort works on the principle that the cosmic rays will flip or corrupt the bits enough such that the array ends up being sorted. | Yes, Eventually | God-willing!!! |
| PowerSort    | Power stack computes a "power-stack" from all of the array combinations, list [a,b,c,d,...] would give a^bcd..., solved right-to-left, then picks the highest value. | Yes, in tetrational time. | Takes a lot of time and memory. |
